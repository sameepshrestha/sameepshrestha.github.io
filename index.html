                    <p>
                        Sameep Shrestha is an Enginner with his bachelors in Mechanical Engineering discipline from Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University.

                        Passion? Well I do think my passion lies in robotics, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. Something about these topics just seem 
                        to bring a joy in my face and problems involving this are ones which I can spend hours of my life. I haven't really achieved something but will try 
                        my best to do so in the coming days. Want to purse these topics in my Master's program and hope will be able to contribute to both my family and though 
                        insignificantly, this world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What other than that? I love to taste food. Though I hate most other than Nepali cusine. I like to be open minded and try everything the world has to offer
                        and to decide on my own for myself if whether the food is tasty or not. Not rich, I just liveby.

                <p>The Asia pacific Robot Contest features 20 nations from 
                    all around Asia with big names such as Japan, China, India and
                    Hongong. For the competition, different universities from these Asian Nation 
                    comes to show off their technology and for sharing knowledge. Nepali students from Tibuvan University from 
                    pulchowk campus represent Nepal every year.

                <p>
                    I participated in the competition for all my undergrad years from 2016-2020. For 2019 robocon we had two robots  
                    per the rules of the challenges. The robot has three actuators with two for
                    linear motion and one for angular. The other robot for the competition was
                    a carrier robot with holonomic drive to carry bigger objects and store them
                    in a location and a physical messenger for the quadruped robot.</p>

                    AI/Ml has taken over the world and this correlelates with the time when I started it myself. My third year in engineering,
                     was when I started to get immersed into it
                    , intirgued by it's capability, I tried exploring the world around it. It's really revolutionay, thoough for someone 
                    with mathematical background, it is quite similar to curve fitting but the level of freedom it captures can hardly
                    be realized by any equations. Data is reallyy the new world. Anyone wanting with to start, I suggest you start with 
                    the course Machine Learning from Standford by Andrew N.g. It's the best place to start.

                    Nepal has also seen a rapid increase of job in this sector though the implementation of it in our development stil delays with
                    respect to the outside world. For some reason the major implementation of AI/ML has been seen in the NLP part of it.
                    Though a fascinating and intersting one, I somewhat lack the taste for it. But, We have just started storing and compiling data,
                    understanding it's capability though 
                    delayed, and in coming days can be truly be implemented in the industrial sector of our country. .

                <p>
                    Since when I started, I have been doing some small projects, reading studies ,and closely understanding 
                    the new that emerges in the sector, mainly in the vision side of things. With AI and vision and fully autonomous 
                    world is sure to arrive soon, and I dearly hope to be part of it too. See you then.
